## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Burnt Sienna (#E97451) for a warm, vintage feel.
- Background color: Antique White (#FAEBD7), a slightly desaturated tan providing a gentle backdrop.
- Accent color: Old Gold (#CFB53B) to highlight interactive elements, giving a classic touch.
- Body and headline font: 'Literata' serif for a vintage, literary style.
- Use simple, elegant icons reminiscent of mid-century modern design. Favor outline-style icons to maintain a refined look.
- Employ a clean, spacious layout, emphasizing visual hierarchy through varied element sizes and spacing. Avoid overcrowding, allowing content to breathe.
- Incorporate subtle, smooth transitions and animations. The spinning vinyl record should have a realistic, slightly imperfect rotation. Minimize other animations to avoid a busy interface.
